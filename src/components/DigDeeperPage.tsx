            Somewhere along the way you learned that taking credit feels dangerous. Maybe it was a parent who said "don't brag," or a culture that rewards quiet suffering. So you built a habit: attribute every win to timing, to luck, to someone else's generosity. The problem isn't humility — it's erasure.

            Try this: the next time someone compliments your work, just say "thank you." No qualifiers. No redirecting. Let the words land. That's not pride — it's presence. You did the work. Let yourself be in the room when it gets acknowledged.
